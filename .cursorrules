# Multi-Agent RAG System

This is a Python FastAPI project building a multi-agent AI system with RAG, vector databases, and semantic memory.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- LangChain + LangChain-OpenAI
- Vector databases: FAISS (local), Pinecone (managed)
- Package management: uv

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
- **PlannerAgent**: Decomposes tasks, defines strategy
- **RetrieverAgent**: Fetches relevant knowledge via RAG
- **ExecutorAgent**: Executes automation actions
- **ValidatorAgent**: Validates outputs and detects failures

### Agent Flow
1. Receive task
2. Planner decomposes into subtasks
3. Retriever fetches relevant context
4. Executor performs actions
5. Validator checks results
6. Produce final response

### Design Principles
- Agents have explicit and limited responsibilities
- Retrieval is intentional, not automatic
- Memory is selective and scoped
- No infinite loops (max iterations enforced)
- Decisions are structured (JSON)
- Costs and latency are tracked

## Agent Rules
- Never hallucinate tool or retrieval results
- If insufficient information, request clarification or escalate
- Tool calls must use structured schemas
- Reasoning is logged but not exposed to end users
- Vector search results must be traceable to sources

## Git
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
