# Deal: Initech Manufacturing

## Overview
- **Company:** Initech Manufacturing
- **Industry:** Manufacturing
- **Size:** Mid-market
- **Employee Count:** 800
- **Deal Value:** $45,000 ARR
- **Outcome:** Lost
- **Close Date:** 2025-07-10
- **Tags:** manufacturing, mid-market, lost-deal

## Deal Summary
Initech Manufacturing was looking to modernize their sales operations. They had been using spreadsheets and needed a proper CRM integration.

## Why We Lost
1. **Price sensitivity:** They chose a cheaper competitor (Alpha Corp at $28K ARR)
2. **Feature mismatch:** They needed manufacturing-specific features we don't have
3. **Timeline:** They wanted implementation in 2 weeks, we quoted 6 weeks
4. **Champion left:** Our internal champion (Sales Director) left mid-deal

## What Went Wrong
- We didn't qualify budget properly in discovery
- Didn't identify the manufacturing-specific requirements early enough
- No executive sponsor to survive the champion departure
- Competitor was already in POC when we entered

## Lessons Learned
- Always confirm budget range in first call
- For manufacturing vertical, we need to partner with industry-specific consultants
- Build relationships with multiple stakeholders, not just one champion
- If competitor is in POC, we need to move faster or walk away

## Recovery Opportunity
Their 1-year contract with Alpha ends July 2026. Set reminder to re-engage in May 2026.
