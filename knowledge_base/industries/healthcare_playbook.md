2. "Have you had any compliance audits recently? How did they go?"
3. "What's your timeline for vendor security review?"
4. "Who is your compliance officer and should they be involved early?"

### Proof Points
- MedTech Inc case study ($75K deal, 45-day close)
- Compliance certification documents
- Security architecture whitepaper

### Common Objections
- "We need HITRUST certification" → We're SOC 2 + HIPAA, HITRUST on roadmap

## Competitive Positioning
