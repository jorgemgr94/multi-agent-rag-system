# Competitor Analysis: Alpha Corp

## Overview
Alpha Corp is our primary competitor in the mid-market segment. Founded in 2018, they have grown rapidly through aggressive pricing and fast implementation promises.

## Market Position
- **Target Market:** SMB to Mid-market
- **Pricing:** 15-25% lower than us
- **Market Share:** ~18% in our target segments
- **Funding:** Series C ($50M)

## Strengths
- Lower price point (typically 20% cheaper)
- Faster implementation (claims 2 weeks vs our 4-6 weeks)
- Strong brand recognition in fintech vertical
- Modern UI that demos well
- Large customer base (3,000+ customers)

## Weaknesses
- No HIPAA compliance (critical for healthcare)
- Limited API capabilities (REST only, no webhooks)
- Poor customer support ratings (3.2/5 on G2)
- No SOC 2 Type II (only Type I)
- High churn rate (~15% annually)
- Limited customization options

## How We Win Against Alpha

### Healthcare Deals
Lead with compliance. They cannot compete on HIPAA. Show our audit reports and compliance certifications upfront. Mention their lack of BAA (Business Associate Agreement).

### Enterprise Deals
Emphasize our API flexibility and webhook support. Enterprise buyers need integration capabilities. Also highlight our dedicated support and lower churn rate.

### Price-Sensitive Deals
Calculate 3-year TCO including:
- Support costs (they charge extra, we include it)
- Integration costs (their limited API = more custom work)
- Switching costs (their high churn suggests issues)

## Common Objections and Responses

### "Alpha is cheaper"
"Let's look at the full picture. Their base price is lower, but they charge extra for support, and their limited API means more integration work. Over 3 years, customers typically spend 30% more with them than with us."

### "Alpha is faster to implement"
"Speed is important, but so is doing it right. Their fast implementation often leads to rework. We take 4-6 weeks because we ensure proper integration and training. Our customer satisfaction post-implementation is 4.8/5 vs their 3.5/5."

### "Alpha has more customers"
"Volume doesn't equal quality. Our retention rate is 95% vs their 85%. We focus on customers who are the right fit and grow with them long-term."

## Competitive Intel
- They're rumored to be raising Series D
- Recently had layoffs in support team (explains rating drop)
- New CEO joined Q1 2025, focus shifting to enterprise
